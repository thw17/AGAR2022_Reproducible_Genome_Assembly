### Reference information
Reference contains the mitochondrial (MT) sequence from the 1000 genomes reference (human_g1k_v37.fasta) available here: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/reference/

The MT sequence was extracted with the command:
```
samtools faidx human_g1k_v37.fasta MT > human_v37_MT.fasta
```

We also downloaded a chimpanzee mitochondrial genome from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/262399649/

We manually renamed the chimpanzee MT genome file after download.
